If you already know a lot about it, but could use some reminders on the different aspects of social psychology, buy it. If you want to know more about why and how you behave towards others, and how subtle cues in the environment can affect your decisions and actions, buy it.The lectures are great and easy to understand, and the professor is very knowledgeable, answers questions fast and suggests additional material when requested.Thanks a lot Andrew for the great effort you put into this course!!",en
